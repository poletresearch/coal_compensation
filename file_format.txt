Value – generation from coal (GWh)


= po_schedule.csv

Phase-out dates (there may be several dates for country; they should be represented by 
	different rows, and the column Code should be used to distinguish between them)

Country – country
Code – code of the case (country/phase-out year combination can be used when a country has several
